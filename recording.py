"""Offscreen video recording for headless verification runs.

The demos are normally watched in the Genesis viewer. For automated verification we
need to run without a viewer and still produce a video artifact, so this module owns
a single offscreen camera and the frame-capture cadence.

It lives in its own module so that both `scenes.py` (which creates the camera) and
`robot_adapter.py` (which drives most of the simulation stepping) can use it without
importing each other.

Usage:
    import recording
    recording.configure(headless=True, video_path="runs/goal1/run.mp4")
    ...                                  # scenes.py attaches the camera at build time
    recording.capture(scene)             # after every scene.step()
    recording.finish(scene)              # writes the mp4

Recording is entirely opt-in: with no `configure()` call every function here is a
no-op and the demos behave exactly as before.
